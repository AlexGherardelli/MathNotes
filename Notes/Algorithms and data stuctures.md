### Quick Learning Path

1. **Graph Theory**: Spend 1-2 days learning graph basics (vertices, edges, paths, cycles, weighted graphs).
2. **Algorithms and Complexity**: Spend 3-4 days on basic algorithms (greedy, dynamic programming) and understand Big-O notation.
3. **Optimization**: Spend 1-2 days on combinatorics and exact/heuristic methods.
4. **Practice and Play with Code**: Use Python (NetworkX, OR-Tools) to play around with small examples of TSP.
5. **Collaborate**: Ask your friend to guide you through their specific TSP approach, applying your newfound knowledge.
